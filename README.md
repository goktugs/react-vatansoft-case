# Requirements for the Project to Work on Your Local

In the project directory, you should run:

### `npm start`

Also for db connection, on another terminal 

### `json-server --watch db.json --port 3004`

# Defiences

1) Db connected but cant make authentication right now.
2) Editing todo list not working.
3) Categorization not working.
